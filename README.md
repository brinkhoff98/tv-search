## TODO
If I had more time with this project I would first fix it so it remembers what you had searched before when you click back from the "More details" view. After that i would like to add some filtering based on genres and rating. After that I would change up the styling and UX a bit to feel more modern and sleek. Would also be nice with some links to where one can watch the show and maybe links to IMDB to see the cast.
